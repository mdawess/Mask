1. Make it a Convolutional NN
  - Need to decide on kernal size
  - Fix: ValueError: Input 0 is incompatible with layer: expected ndim=4, found ndim=2 -> Need to add dimensions
  - https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/
2. Change output layer from 2 -> 1 (May need to reorganize pictures etc)
  - Need to convert to binary without 1 hot encoding (Should be very easy)
